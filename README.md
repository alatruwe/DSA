Data Structures and Algorithm pratice

This module covers some classic, foundational topics from computer science. We'll learn how to analyze algorithms in terms of their time complexity, which is to say, how long they take to finish their work. We'll learn how to use big O notation to classify the time complexity of different algorithms, which will allow us to quantify how much better or worse a particular algorithm is in terms of solving some problem.

We'll also learn about implementing common data structures like arrays, linked lists, hash maps, and trees.

Computer science is the subject of multiyear courses of study, and we cannot explore the topic in depth in this course. That said, there are a small number of topics that can be learned relatively quickly that will take you far.
